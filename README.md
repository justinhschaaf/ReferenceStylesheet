## How does this work?

The website pulls all of the colors from a [JSON file stored on a static website](https://content.justinschaaf.com/common/colors/colors.json) and generates the pages and swatches as the file specifies.

## Pro Tips

- You can share a color from the color swatch generator with the link `https://colors.justinschaaf.com/g/{COLOR}`, with `{COLOR}` being replaced
with the color you want to share (e.g. [`https://colors.justinschaaf.com/g/446688`](https://colors.justinschaaf.com/g/446688)).

# Angular Reference

This is directly from the default Angular project README. All credit to the original authors.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
